Defend-the-Institute
====================

This is our final project for 6.177: Introduction to Python. It is a Galaga-clone. If you aren't familiar with Galaga, it is a simple, very old, 1-person shooter game in which a ship is trying to defend itself from some sort of alien invasion. Our game has been implemented using pygame, a completely free software package used for easily creating games in python.
